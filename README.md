# Stock Market and Sentiment Analysis
This project explores the relationship between stock market performance and public sentiment using Python. By analyzing historical trading data alongside a fear and greed index, the goal is to uncover insights that could drive smarter trading strategies.


## Features

-Data Integration: Combines historical stock market trading data with an external sentiment index.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses pandas and numpy for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.

- Data Visualization: Leverages matplotlib and seaborn to visualize trends and correlations, such as the relationship between a trader's profit/loss (PnL) and the sentiment score.

- Insights Generation: Identifies key patterns and provides actionable insights based on the analysis.
